## üöÄ Benefits of Deterministic Format

### ‚úÖ **100% Accuracy**
- No more NLP parsing failures
- Regex-based parsing for reliability
- Instant processing without AI delays

### ‚úÖ **Performance Optimized**
- No OpenAI API calls needed
- 20x fewer database queries (10-min intervals vs 30-sec)
- Reduced server load and costs

### ‚úÖ **Your Preferred Style**
- Perfect for 10-minute multiple scheduling
- Supports all your common time patterns
- Flexible enough for any scheduling need

### ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**
- Old natural language format still works
- Automatic fallback to OpenAI parsing
- No disruption to existing workflows

---

## üîß Technical Details

### **Parsing Priority:**
1. **Deterministic parsing** (new format) - 100% accuracy
2. **OpenAI fallback** (old format) - for backward compatibility

### **10-Minute Optimization:**
- Database scans every 10 minutes at :00, :10, :20, :30, :40, :50
- ¬±2 minute window for sending reminders
- Efficient resource usage

### **Timezone:**
- All times processed in **Asia/Kolkata (IST)**
- Automatic date adjustment for past times

## üìã Quick Reference Card

**Copy-paste these examples and modify as needed:**

```
# Quick reminders
@Slackbot [+10m] your message here thread: <link>
@Slackbot [+20m] your message here thread: <link>

# Today's schedule
@Slackbot [11:20PM] your message here thread: <link>
@Slackbot [1:40AM] your message here thread: <link>

# Tomorrow's schedule
@Slackbot [T+11:20PM] your message here thread: <link>
@Slackbot [T+9:00AM] your message here thread: <link>

# Specific date (July 8, 2025 example)
@Slackbot [2025-07-08@13:00] your message here thread: <link>
@Slackbot [2025-07-08@1:20PM] your message here thread: <link>
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Format not working?**
1. Ensure brackets `[]` are around the time spec
2. Check for typos in time format
3. Verify thread link is included
4. Falls back to OpenAI parsing if deterministic fails

### **Common Mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `@Slackbot +10m` (missing brackets)
- ‚ùå `@Slackbot [10m]` (missing + for relative time)
- ‚ùå `@Slackbot [11:20]` (missing AM/PM for 12-hour format)
- ‚úÖ `@Slackbot [+10m]` (correct relative format)
- ‚úÖ `@Slackbot [11:20PM]` (correct 12-hour format)
